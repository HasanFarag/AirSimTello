Download and build Airsim as normal for your perticular build. see https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim
git clone https://github.com/dji-sdk/Tello-Python.git
python -m pip install tello py
copy, paste, replace the tello py file into your anaconda site packages directory under the internal tab.
run airsim in unity or unreal engine then run the airsimtellopycontrol file and you will see live simulation at the same
as real world location movement with some lag.

this is a work in progress.

this was designed so i could use unreal engine and unitys graphics engine to create real world simulations with the ability to transfer
simulation data into real world applictions. I.E. a farmer wants to create a realistic version of his farm based on gis data from terrain.party 
and High defininition assets/polygon models that are realistic enough to train computer vision models on so he can build autonomous systems.
